# Prediction of Product Sales

**What is this project about?**

This project will examine a dataset showing various aspects of sales at grocery stores and outlets, in the hopes relevant patterns can be detected 
to forecast or improve future sales. We will examine the data with tools we have encountered thus far, including data handling libraries such as
Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn.

**Why are we doing this project?**

This project will help teach the fundamental skills for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis that will be vital to success as a data scientist. 

# Product Sales Analysis
### A) Total number of sales based upon outlet store type

- Above we see average total sales based upon the type of outlet store. We can see that Supermarket Types 1 and 2 are the most similar,
while Type 3 has noticably higher sales and Grocery stores have very little.







### B) Frequency of outlet store type based upon location

- We can see Location 1 shows an uneven distribution between Supermarket Type 1 and Grocery Stores, while Location 2 seems to be reserved for Supermarket Type 1.

- Supermarket Type 3, despite showing higher sales than all other groups, does not have a noticably higher number of stores, and exists in the same locations
as all other types of stores as well.
